                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <span><!-- line here --></span>
				
                <p>Just like any business venture. It all started with an idea. CYROK E-Market was created to 
						provide a ‘one-stop-grocery-shop’ to consumers, however, I’m sure you have heard that statement 
						before, so what makes us different? CYROK's goal is to provide customers with a convenient online 
						shopping experience from anywhere in Jamaica. Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world in more ways than one. 
						Consumers are relying on the digital world now more than ever and businesses are forced to adapt their strategies and 
						shift toward digital transformation. CYROK E-Market facilitates multiple supermarkets and grocery retailers,
						providing customers with a convenient means of shopping from the comfort of their homes at any supermarket of their choice</p>
						
				<h3>Vision</h3>
                <span><!-- line here --></span>
				
                <p>To provide our customers the ability to shop online from the comfort of their homes and have access to multiple supermarkets or 
			       retail stores in their area at their fingertips. </p>
						
				<h4>Mission</h4>
                <span><!-- line here --></span>
				
                <p>Our mission is to provide our customers with top-notch convenient services.
				   We aim to eliminate the need for long lines in the supermarkets,promote social 
                   distancing, and have customers do all their shopping from the comfort of their homes at any supermarket of their choice.
